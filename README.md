# Truth table builder for given simple logical expression. 

## Support for variable names
The parser part supports all single-char alphabetical variable names:
```
'a'..='z'
```
and operation signs:
```
'∧'
'∨'
'¬' 
'('
')'
```

The program part supports variable names x, y, z, w, but it is easily extendable to support any number of variable names.
